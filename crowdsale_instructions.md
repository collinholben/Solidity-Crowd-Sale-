In order to participate with this crowdsale you will first need to import the coin into your metamask. Log onto metamask and change you network to the Rinkeby test net. Scroll to the bottom of metamask, and click 'add token', then go to custom token and imput the token address (0xF902101db4EB2708dD8E0C9f14569Da2161d7df3). This should bring up the "pup" coin. Click add coin and the coin should now be displaying on your metamask with a balance of zero.
